## Overview

In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of wines. The dataset we used contains various features related to wine attributes and their corresponding quality ratings. We have applied different machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality and evaluated their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality Dataset. You can find it in the `data` directory. The dataset is provided as two separate CSV files, one for red wines and the other for white wines. You can explore the dataset to understand its structure and the attributes used for prediction.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files (winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- `src/`: Source code for the machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed. You can find the list of required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd wine-quality-prediction
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Wine Quality Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Open a Jupyter notebook and explore the provided notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. These notebooks contain detailed explanations of data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.

2. You can also use the Python scripts in the `src` directory to run the models and generate predictions.

3. Customize and experiment with the model by modifying the code as needed for your specific requirements.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

We have implemented the following machine learning algorithms for wine quality prediction:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines

You can find the code for each algorithm in the `src` directory.

## Results

We have evaluated the performance of each machine learning algorithm using various metrics, such as mean squared error and accuracy. The results of the model predictions are available in the project's Jupyter notebooks.
